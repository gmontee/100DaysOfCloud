# Day 2 - Azure AZ-104 Manage Azure Active Directory Identities Lab

## Introduction

‚úçÔ∏è I mentioned yesterday I completed [A Cloud Guru's AZ-104 Microsoft Azure Administrator certification prep course](https://acloudguru.com/course/az-104-microsoft-azure-administrator-certification-prep). Although, they provide hands-on labs, I still want to do [Microsoft Learn AZ-104 Lab Exercises](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/AZ-104-MicrosoftAzureAdministrator/). Today, I will be doing Lab 1 Manage Azure Active Directory Identities.

## Prerequisite
