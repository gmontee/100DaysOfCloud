# AZ-104 Azure Administrator Exam Day!

## Introduction

Today is the day! After ~45 days of studying, I take my AZ-104 exam.

## Prerequisite

This exam doesn't have an official prerequisite. The expectation is a person has 6 months of hands-on Azure experience. Combined with knowledge of core Azure services, Azure workloads, security, and governance.

They do recommend that if you're new to cloud, to do the [AZ-900 Learning path](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/az-900-describe-cloud-concepts/), and take that [exam](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900).

## Use Case

</div>
"Candidates for this exam should have subject matter expertise implementing, managing, and monitoring an organization’s Microsoft Azure environment."

"Responsibilities for this role include implementing, managing, and monitoring identity, governance, storage, compute, and virtual networks in a cloud environment, plus provision, size, monitor, and adjust resources, when needed."

"An Azure administrator often serves as part of a larger team dedicated to implementing an organization's cloud infrastructure."

## Cloud Research

As I previously mentioned on [Day 1](https://github.com/gmontee/100DaysOfCloud/tree/main/Journey/001), I officially started my cloud journey last year, while doing Amazon Web Services Infrastructure-as-a-Service work. Then earlier this year, 2022, with a project change at work, I started down the Azure path. I studied for the AZ-900 Azure Fundamentals exam for roughly a month. After passing that I took single day's break, and then started working on the AZ-104.

On an episode of the [CloudSkills.fm](https://cloudskills.fm/) podcast, [Tim Warner](https://techtrainertim.com/) mentioned the three legs of the certification stool.

1. Knowledge
2. Hands-on Practice
3. Test taking skills

### Step 1 — Knowledge

I went with A Cloud Guru's "AZ-104 Microsoft Azure Administrator Certification Prep" course. It's roughly 34 hours of content over 100+ lessons, and a couple dozen labs.

I also utilzied John Savill's free Onboard to Azure youtube series, specifically his [AZ-104 super cram session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOod_VNgdJk).

### Step 2 — Hands-on Practice

In addition to the A Cloud Guru's labs for the hands-on practice, I utlized [Microsoft Learn's Github page](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/AZ-104-MicrosoftAzureAdministrator/) has over a dozen labs. They are done well. I caution you to make sure you set up budget alerts before doing any labs, in case you forget any resources that cost.

### Step 3 — Test taking skills

For taking pracitice exams, I went with [Tutorial Dojo's AZ-104 Microsoft Azure Administrator Practice Exams](https://portal.tutorialsdojo.com/courses/az-104-microsoft-azure-administrator-practice-exams/). The material was well presented, and they explained why answers were right and wrong.

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

I PASSED!! Talk about sweating bullets. I scored 767, and taking into account my current experience level, I consider that a victory.

## Next Steps

Trying to decide what next on my journey. Might finish the AZ-104 labs. Also looking at starting on Docker and Kubernetes, or Bicep and Terraform.
