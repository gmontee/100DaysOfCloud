# Welcome

## Introduction

‚úçÔ∏è I'm currently working towards my Azure AZ-104 Administrator certification. I'm going to explain how I got to this point, and my progress to this cert.

## Prerequisite

‚úçÔ∏è If you're coming with experience from another Cloud provider, e.g., Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, IBM Cloud, Oracle Cloud, VMware Cloud (I'm noticing a pattern in the naming scheme :laughing:), you'll find what the AZ-104 covers is fairly rudimentary. We're talking virtual networks, compute, storage, etc. Microsoft went the straight forward route when naming their services, and anything above the region level tends to be prefixed with 'Azure'. The _major_ difference (I used that term loosely) coming from another Cloud provider, will be governance, service level agreements, and like, but nothing radical.

‚úçÔ∏è If you're brand new to Cloud, the Cloud providers have introductory, on-boarding learning paths to help learn Cloud terminology. The best part of this area is all the resources you need are free, and usually the Providers will give exam discounts, or even free. They're incentivized for you to get started!

- Microsoft Azure:
  - [Microsoft's Learning Path](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-fundamentals/)
  - John Savill's [On-Board to Azure Youtube series](https://learn.onboardtoazure.com/)
  - Microsoft's [Virtual Training Days](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trainingdays/azure)
- Amazon Web Services:
  - AWS has their [Certified Cloud Practitioner](https://aws.amazon.com/training/learn-about/cloud-practitioner/)
  - Recent to the space, is their gamified offering [AWS Cloud Quest](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/course/external/view/elearning/11458/aws-cloud-quest-cloud-practitioner?lacp=sec&sec=lp)
- Google Cloud:
  - Google provides [Learning Paths](https://cloud.google.com/training#learning-paths)
  - Their introductory cert is [Cloud Digital Leader](https://cloud.google.com/certification/cloud-digital-leader)

## Use Case

<img src="az-104-roadmap.jpg" alt="chart showing various Azure Certs" align="middle" width="400"/>

- üñºÔ∏è Above is the various Azure certifications, and my current location in that path, studying for the AZ-104..
- ‚úçÔ∏è Earlier this year (2022), I started down the Azure road, used Microsoft's Learning Path for the AZ-900, and John Savil's On-Board to Azure youtube course. I did create an Azure account, and looked around, but at this point everything I had to learn was purely knowledge-based. After passing, I jumped into studying for the AZ-104. The primary resource I used was [A Cloud Guru's AZ-104 Microsoft Azure Administrator certification prep course](https://acloudguru.com/course/az-104-microsoft-azure-administrator-certification-prep).

## Cloud Research

- ‚úçÔ∏è Over the years, I have used a variety of resources for learning Technology. Often, the creator or company will provide primary documentation in various states, from bare-bones to extensive labors of love. Youtube, Medium, personal blogs, will provide good introductions to a topic. I've used Udemy, with some research, you can find **excellent** courses with superb content. Through my employer I have used PluralSight, whose content just doesn't speak to me. It's hard for me to articulate, PluralSight's content is polished and organized, but it lacks 'life', 'soul', 'pizzazz'. Using Linkedin, Reddit, and Youtube, I noticed common resources will appear when studying for certain exams. 'A Cloud Guru' popped up numerous times, and I was drawn in by their straight-forward presentation. More importantly, they provice Cloud Sandbox environments for the major 3! There are some limitations, but it enables hands-on labs in an actual environment, and plenty of room to experiment. So far, I've been enjoying their content.

Depending on what you're used to paying, they subscription can be a bit pricey. For instance, Udemy courses range all over the place, but because they're constantly have _sales_, you can usually pick up a course for $10-20. A Cloud Guru has subscriptions on a monthly or annual basis, with the add-on for those Cloud Sandboxes I mentioned earlier. Currently at the time I'm writing this (April 2022), an Personal Plus annual plan is $468. I'm lucky because my employer provides me a pot of money for Education and learning. A Cloud Guru does provide sales for major holidays, I've been seeing 40% to 50% off. If you do their 7-day trial, you can try waiting to see if they offer a discount. Of course, you can always straight up ask them directly.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Outcome

‚úçÔ∏è I believe the biggest factor 'hurting' me in learning Azure, is I don't currently have direct hands-on opportunties in my daily work load. It feels like a 'chicken and egg' problem. For the roles I'm seeing, I need 'X' amount of experience in Azure, Terraform, Python, etc. I'm having to upskill in my free time (it's Sunday afternoon as I write this) to achieve a certain level of competence. I feel like I"m taking an artificial path rather than an organic one to get there. I guess it's the reality I'm in, and to make the best of it. I'm looking up to where I **WANT** to be, and will carve a path onto that trail.

## Next Steps

‚úçÔ∏è Tomorrow, I'm going to start doing the AZ-104 labs provided by Microsoft on their [Github](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/AZ-104-MicrosoftAzureAdministrator/) page.
