# Day 54 - Reflections on Climbing the Mountain

If you have ever been around me, you will have occasionally heard me reminiscence about growing up in Northern Maine, Aroostook County to be exact. I spent a tremendous amount of my childhood in the great outdoors: Hiking, backpacking, canoeing, cycling, fishing, hunting, snowmobiling, and camping throughout the year, summer, fall, winter, and even "mud season".

During my teenage years, a couple of times Dad and I did the hike of hikes, climbing Mount Katahdin, which is darn close to a mile high at 5,269 feet.

It was hike that had to be planned, as it was barely doable in a day. To even get down there was a long, three hour drive; which meant waking up well before dawn to get on the road. The average range for hiking up and down Katahdin is 8 to 12 hours.

The critical factors for success were being in good shape, an experienced hiker, and broken in hiking shoes. Initially, the trail was a gradual slope but a third way up the elevation started dramatically increasing. Similar to running, we fell into a sustainable rhythm as we climbed. At an elevation of 3,500 feet the trees would disappear, leaving only glacially carved granite to be scrabbled over.

One of the peaks is called Pamola, named after a mythological Abenaki bird spirit that caused storms and cold. _All the effort and struggle_ to get there dwarfed the miniscule time we had to enjoy that view. It was a temporary reprieve, **standing there above the clouds**, before having to return down the mountain in order to make it back before dusk.

I suffer greatly from **imposter syndrome**. Over the years, it has come and gone; but this past year it has enveloped me. I struggle to breathe as it attempts to suffocate me. I have these near constant feelings of self-doubt. The anxiety of being found out that I'm a fraud puts me in a perpetual state of fight or flight. Like a tide, the panic attacks roll in and out.

I know, logically, it _doesn't make sense_. I've been working with computers since age ten, when I received my Grandfather's old Zenith Z-150, which gave way to Apple II's, Tandy 1000's, and Pentium IIs/IIIs. I created web pages in the '90s, with the newly created HTML and CSS. My Eagle Scout project was a database for the local historical society. I went to community college, learning the IBM AS/400, with it's Report Program Generator that had been extended into a bastardized programming language.

I spent 16 of my 20 years in the Air Force doing software engineering; specially quality assurance testing, database development, identity management, and full stack development. From monolithic mainframe programs to modern single-page web applications; waterfall to Agile.

I have a lifetime of experience and knowledge. However, to quote Aristotle, "The more you know, the more you realize you don't know". I occasionally I look at the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation landscape map](https://landscape.cncf.io/), and I cry out in anguish. It's staggering.
