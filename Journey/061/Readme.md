# Day 61 - Terraform - Data Sources

## Introduction

☁️ Today, I'm going to learn about the Data Source block in Terraform

## Prerequisite

☁️ Data Source blocks define resources outside Terraform's control, or defined by another Terraform configuration

## Use Case

☁️ Depending on your environment, particularly brownfields, there may already be resources in place that you don't want Terraform managing. However, you may need a way to reference them. That's where data source blocks come in.

☁️ They're similar to how you would lay out a resource block, however you can't use arguments that would manipulate them, since they are _read_ only.
