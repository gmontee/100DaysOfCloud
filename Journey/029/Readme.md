# AZ-204 Azure Developer Exam Day!

## Introduction

Today is the day! After ~30 days of studying, I take my AZ-204 exam.

## Prerequisite

This exam doesn't have an official prerequisite. The expectation is a person has 1-2 years of development experience and experience with Azure. Candidates are cloud developers who participate in all phases of development from requirements definition and design to development, deployment, and maintenance. They partner with cloud DBAs, cloud administrators, and clients to implement solutions.

They do recommend that if you're new to cloud, to do the [AZ-900 Learning path](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/az-900-describe-cloud-concepts/), and take that [exam](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900).

## Use Case

## Cloud Research

As I previously mentioned on [Day 1](https://github.com/gmontee/100DaysOfCloud/tree/main/Journey/001), I officially started my cloud journey last year, while doing Amazon Web Services Infrastructure-as-a-Service work. Then earlier this year, 2022, with a project change at work, I started down the Azure path. I studied for the AZ-900 Azure Fundamentals exam for roughly a month. After passing that I took single day's break, and then started working on the AZ-104. Studying for the AZ-104 took me roughly 45 days, and I was able to pass that exam as well.

On an episode of the [CloudSkills.fm](https://cloudskills.fm/) podcast, [Tim Warner](https://techtrainertim.com/) mentioned the three legs of the certification stool.

1. Knowledge
2. Hands-on Practice
3. Test taking skills

### Step 1 — Knowledge

I went with A Cloud Guru's "AZ-204 Developing Solutions for Microsoft Azure Certification Prep" course. It's roughly 19 hours of content over 55 lessons, and a dozen labs.

### Step 2 — Hands-on Practice

In addition to the A Cloud Guru's labs for the hands-on practice, I utlized [Microsoft Learn's Github page](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/AZ-204-DevelopingSolutionsforMicrosoftAzure/), which has a dozen labs. They are done well. I caution you to make sure you set up budget alerts before doing any labs, in case you forget any resources that cost.

### Step 3 — Test taking skills

For taking pracitice exams, I went with [Whizlabs' AZ-204 Microsoft Azure Developer Practice Exams](https://www.whizlabs.com/microsoft-azure-certification-az-204/). The material was well presented, and they explained why answers were right and wrong.

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

VICTORY! I did it. That was soooooo intense. Working within a IDE or Text Editor you get extremely use to having autocomplete, and the ease of looking up command line inputs or code examples in the Microsoft Docs. 

## Next Steps

Next is to start learning Docker; at least enought to make me dangerous!
